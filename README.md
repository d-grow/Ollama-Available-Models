# Ollama Available Models

We crawl Ollama daily to gather and update all available models in a single JSON file, making it easy for anyone to integrate up-to-date model information into their projects.


This repository is part of our ongoing efforts to support our project, **ShareAI**, available at (https://shareai.now) â€“ a decentralized solution that allows anyone with a PC to share AI resources within the community. Users earn tokens for each prompt they respond to within the community, which they can later use to access shared resources themselves. Through this collaborative approach, we aim to promote a fair and accessible AI ecosystem for everyone.
